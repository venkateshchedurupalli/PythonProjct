#Python Numbers variable
a=12

#print Variable as define format here define is integer
print (a)
#output would be
#12

#print Variable as integer convert from define format he a=12 is integer hence will
print (int(a))
#output would be changed
#12

#print variable as float value from integer as denine
print (float(a))
#output would be
#12.0

#print variable as complex value from integer as denine
#https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#complex
print (complex(a))
#output would be
#(12+0j)

#for float value change to inter will work like as below
b=12.12
print (int(b))
#output would be the integer value as
#12


# How do we find the variable type from definirion of variable
a=12
print (type(a))
#ouput would be
#

a=12.1 
print (type(a))
#ouput would be
#

a=1+2J
print (type(a))
#ouput would be
#

a=True
print (type(a))
#ouput would be
